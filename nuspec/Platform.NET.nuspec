Platform.NET

A cross-platform library of useful classes and extensions for C# and .NET.

This library was initially developed between 2003-2008. It has been updated to use modern C# syntax and released as open source under the BSD license. It is the foundation of my other C# projects including the projects located at the GitHub [Platform.NET](https://github.com/platformdotnet) organisation.

Some notable classes provided are: TimedReferenceDictionary, ExpressionVisitor, NetworkTimeClient, NotifyingWeakReference, TimedReference, ReferenceQueue, ITask, IMeter, InteractiveCryptoStream, TextConversion, InvocationQueue, XmlSerializer
